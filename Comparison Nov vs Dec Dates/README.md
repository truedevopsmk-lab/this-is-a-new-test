## Short recommendation

* If your goal is **to experience Christmas in Europe** (markets, lights, events): **choose KLM / Air France (Dec 15–28)** — it places you there for Dec 24–26 and saves ~**₹9,549 per person**.
* If you value **shorter total travel time, a premium transfer hub (DOH)** and possibly **more flexible fare rules**, pick **Qatar** — but note it **does not** cover Christmas dates.

---

## Next steps I can do for you

* Add this comparison table into your **README** (I can update Trip #01 entry).
* Produce a **Christmas checklist / day-by-day** for Budapest & Prague (markets, reservations, transport tips).
* Contact your travel agent text (one-liner recommendation + fare codes) you can copy/paste.

Which one would you like me to add to the repo next?

# Quick numeric comparison (per passenger)

* **Option A — Qatar (your original)**: **₹67,757** per passenger
* **Option B — KLM / Air France (new)**: **₹58,208** per passenger
  **Savings if you pick Option B:** **₹9,549** per passenger (₹67,757 − ₹58,208 = ₹9,549)

> Note: your second option shows **Number of passengers x2** and **total ₹116,416** — I treated the figures as **per passenger** for fair comparison.

# Travel time (elapsed door-to-door on routing you provided)

**Outbound (BLR → BUD)**

* **Qatar:** 4h35 + 3h40 layover + 5h30 = **13h 45m** total elapsed
* **KLM:** 10h35 + 2h45 layover + 2h00 = **15h 20m** total elapsed
  **Qatar is ~1h35 faster outbound.**

**Return (PRG → BLR)**

* **Qatar:** 5h45 + 3h05 layover + 4h00 = **12h 50m** total elapsed
* **Air France:** 2h00 + 1h45 layover + 9h30 = **13h 15m** total elapsed
  **Qatar is ~25 minutes faster return.**

---

# Carrier / product / operational notes

* **Qatar (Option A)** — long-haul on **A350 / 787**, Doha (DOH) hub — typically good transfer experience and long-haul comfort. Booking codes: **T / Q**. Return was **codeshare-operated by Indigo** in your earlier update (be mindful if you prefer full-QR metal).
* **KLM / Air France (Option B)** — outbound longhaul on **B777**, short regional sector on **Embraer 190 (KLM Cityhopper)**; return uses **A220 + B777**. Some regional legs are on smaller aircraft and a KLM Cityhopper/operated-by note appears (OK — common, but check checked-baggage & transfer protection).
* **Operated by / codeshare**: Option B has **operated-by** notes (Cityhopper / Indigo) — fine, but check seating, meals and baggage allowances for the *operating* carrier.

---

# Fare rules & risk

* **Option B explicitly says:** *This ticket is non-refundable.*
* **Option A says:** changes/cancellations will incur penalty fees (less explicit about non-refundable).
  If flexibility/refundability matters, **Option A (Qatar)** may be safer — confirm the exact refund/change rules with the agent before booking.

---

# Other practical considerations

* **Dates differ**: Option A was for late Nov → early Dec; Option B is mid-Dec → late Dec. If your travel dates are fixed, that alone decides it.
* **Departure times**: Option B outbound departs BLR **2:30 AM** (very early) — factor convenience / overnight travel to airport.
* **Layovers**: DOH vs AMS/CDG — DOH is an excellent transfer hub with lounges; AMS/CDG are major European hubs (CDG transfers sometimes tighter).
* **YR/YQ surcharges**: Option B shows a very large **YR (₹29,240)** — strange but reflected in subtotal; total still comes out cheaper per pax. Worth asking the agent why YR is that high (pricing oddities happen).

---

# Recommendation (short)

* **Pick Option B (KLM/AF)** if **saving money (~₹9.5k per person)** is the priority and you’re okay with the slightly longer travel time, earlier BLR departure (2:30 AM) and the *non-refundable* condition.
* **Pick Option A (Qatar)** if you value **shorter total travel time, potentially better long-haul product and transfer experience at DOH, and slightly more flexible/changeable fare** (verify rules).

If you want, I can:

* Compare **total elapsed times in a compact table** for copy/paste into your README,
* Pull up **official fare rule snippets** (I’d need to search the carrier/PNR — I can do that), or
* Produce a one-line recommendation you can paste to a travel agent. Which would you like next?
